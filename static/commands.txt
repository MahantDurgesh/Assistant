***********facts---
1-Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't: Botanically speaking, bananas are classified as berries because they develop from a flower with a single ovary, while strawberries, despite their name, are not berries. They are actually considered aggregate fruits because they form from a flower with multiple ovaries.

2-The shortest war in history lasted only 38 minutes: It was between Britain and Zanzibar on August 27, 1896. Zanzibar surrendered after just 38 minutes.

3-Cleopatra VII of Egypt lived closer in time to the Moon landing than to the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza: Cleopatra lived from 69 BCE to 30 BCE, while the Great Pyramid of Giza was completed around 2560 BCE. The Moon landing occurred in 1969 CE.

4-A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance: These brightly colored birds certainly live up to their name when they gather together!

5-The unicorn is the national animal of Scotland: Despite being a mythical creature, the unicorn has been the national animal of Scotland since the 12th century.

6-Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood: These fascinating creatures have two hearts that pump blood to their gills and one heart that pumps blood to the rest of their body. Their blood is also blue due to the presence of hemocyanin, a copper-based protein.

7-Honey never spoils: Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Its low water content and acidic pH create an environment that prevents the growth of bacteria and fungi.

8-The Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye: Despite the common myth, astronauts need aid such as binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see the Great Wall from space.

9-The Eiffel Tower can be 15 cm taller during the summer: Due to thermal expansion, the iron structure of the Eiffel Tower expands when heated by the sun, causing it to grow in height.
